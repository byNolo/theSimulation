# The Simulation - Fresh Start

## Starting Configuration

### Initial Stats (Day 1)
- **Morale**: 70 / 100 (Stable)
- **Supplies**: 80 / 100 (Healthy)
- **Threat**: 30 / 100 (Low)
- **Status**: "Genesis" - The community begins

### What to Expect

#### First Event
With starting stats in the stable range, you'll likely see:
- **Daily/General Events** - Resource allocation, community decisions
- **Opportunity Events** - Since supplies and morale are good
- **No Crisis Events** - Stats are healthy

#### First Few Days (1-5)
- Focus on learning the mechanics
- Options will have clear labels and descriptions
- See how each choice affects the three stats
- Build your strategy

### Quick Tips

1. **Balance is Key**: No stat should hit 0 or 100
2. **Read Descriptions**: Each option explains its consequences
3. **Long-term Thinking**: Small changes accumulate over time
4. **Crisis Prevention**: Don't let any stat get too low/high
5. **Community Vote**: Discuss choices with other players

### Danger Zones
- **Morale < 30**: Risk of community collapse
- **Supplies < 30**: Food shortage imminent
- **Threat > 70**: External danger critical

### Sample Decision Flow

**Day 1 Example** - "Daily Resource Allocation"
- **Balanced Approach**: +2 morale, +3 supplies, -2 threat (safe choice)
- **Focus on Defense**: -3 morale, -2 supplies, -8 threat (aggressive)
- **Focus on Gathering**: +1 morale, +8 supplies, +4 threat (risky)
